# Flaggi ðŸš©

_Tournament Tournament Tournament_ submision from [Samuel](https://github.com/Snapshot20) and [MatÄ›j](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii) for the **RHS Videogame Development Club** It is a Java game compiled using `Java 8` and `Gradle`.

## Game overview

Flaggi is a simple game where two players take turns placing flags on a grid. The objective is to be the first player to collect 3 flags.

## Game installation

Install the latest release of the `Server.jar` and `Flaggi.jar` from the [releases](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii/Flaggi/releases). Run the server by using the command:

```bash
java -jar Server.jar
```

The server will log the IP it was creted on. Paste this ip into an `ip.txt` file in the same directory as the `Flaggi.jar` and run the game by using the command:

```bash
java -jar Flaggi.jar
```

If there is no `ip.txt` the user local IP will be used. This will work if the server is running on the same computer as the client.
